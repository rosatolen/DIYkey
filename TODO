* change D- from pb3 to pb0 and D+ from pb4 to pb1, then change LED from +5V to 3 or 2
    - ** requires change in DigiKeyboard library
* fix button

Tech Debt
- We don't need micronucleus's delay. We only need the V-USB code
- We need better control of the compilation of the DigiKeyboard code (i.e. controlling how it sets the D+ and D- pins which is in 
  /home/rosatolen/.arduino15/packages/digistump/hardware/avr/1.6.7/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard/usbconfig.h)
